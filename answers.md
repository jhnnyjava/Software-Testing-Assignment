# Answers to Assignment 1: Fundamentals of Software Testing

## 1. Definition and Importance of Software Testing
### Definition:
Software testing is the process of evaluating a software application to identify and resolve defects, ensuring that it meets the specified requirements and functions correctly.

### Importance:
- **Ensures Quality**: Helps deliver a reliable and high-quality product.
- **Detects Errors Early**: Identifies bugs before software deployment.
- **Enhances Security**: Reduces vulnerabilities that can be exploited.
- **Improves Performance**: Ensures the software functions efficiently under various conditions.
- **Customer Satisfaction**: Ensures the software meets user expectations and business needs.

## 2. Difference Between Error, Defect, and Failure

| Term     | Definition | Example |
|----------|------------|----------|
| **Error** | A mistake made by a developer during coding. | A developer incorrectly writes a formula, leading to miscalculations. |
| **Defect (Bug)** | A flaw in the software that causes incorrect results. | A login button does not function as expected due to incorrect event handling. |
| **Failure** | When the software behaves unexpectedly in a real-world scenario. | A banking app crashes when a user attempts to transfer money. |

## 3. The "Pesticide Paradox" Principle
### Explanation:
The "Pesticide Paradox" states that if the same set of test cases is executed repeatedly, they become less effective at detecting new defects. Over time, these test cases fail to uncover new issues, making them obsolete.

### Importance of Updating Test Cases:
- **Identifies New Defects**: Regularly modifying test cases ensures new issues are detected.
- **Improves Test Coverage**: Helps cover different parts of the application.
- **Enhances Software Quality**: Reduces the risk of undetected defects.
- **Adapts to Software Changes**: As software evolves, test cases must also evolve to remain relevant.

## 4. Static vs. Dynamic Testing

| Type     | Description | Example |
|----------|------------|----------|
| **Static Testing** | Testing software without executing the code. | Code reviews, walkthroughs, and static analysis tools. |
| **Dynamic Testing** | Testing software by executing the code and validating output. | Running a unit test to verify a functionâ€™s correctness. |

## 5. Benefits of Early Testing in SDLC
### How Early Testing Reduces Costs & Improves Quality:
- **Detects Issues Early**: Fixing defects in initial stages (e.g., requirements phase) is cheaper than post-deployment.
- **Reduces Rework**: Identifies issues before significant development effort is invested.
- **Enhances Software Reliability**: Ensures robust architecture from the beginning.
- **Saves Time & Resources**: Reduces the overall cost and time spent on debugging.
- **Boosts Customer Satisfaction**: Leads to a smoother user experience and fewer post-release issues.

### Example:
If a design flaw is detected during the requirements phase, it can be corrected before coding begins, preventing costly rework later in the development process.
